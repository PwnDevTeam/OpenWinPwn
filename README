 
 OpenWinPwn was created for Windows users so they can generate
 a simple so called "Hello World" template for iDevice payloads.
 
 OpenPwn was originally made for Mac users only. (With a little bit of hacking, Linux users were able to use it aswell)
 But OpenWinPwn made it possible for Windows users to use OpenPwn. 

 OpenWinPwn usage:  OpenWinPwn.bat <payload name> <author>  OR  Start OpenWinPwn.bat and follow the instructions.
